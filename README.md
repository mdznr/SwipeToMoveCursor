SwipeToMoveCursor
=================
This is a `UITextView` subclass which adds `UISwipeGestureRecognizer` gesture recognizers which moves the cursor left and right according to the direction of the swipe.

A few apps have implemented something similar in their UITextViews and I decided to try and it out and see how easy it was to make.

###Future:
+ Possibly some way of moving word by word instead of character by character
+ Moving one end of a selection left/right instead of the entire selection
	+ again, moved character by character or word by word
